  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Thank you for choosing the BMI Tracker. This Privacy Policy describes 
    how the App collects, uses, and shares information when you use our services. By installing 
    and using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>1.1 No Personal Information Collected</h3>
  <p>
    The App does not require you to provide personal information such as name, email address, 
    or contact details. The App calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height 
    and weight inputs, but does not store, track, or transmit these inputs to any server.
  </p>

  <h3>1.2 Non-Personal Usage Data</h3>
  <p>
    The App does not use third-party analytics tools by default. If future updates introduce 
    analytics to improve user experience, any data collected will be anonymized and used 
    solely for performance metrics. This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>
    All BMI calculations occur locally on your device. The height and weight values you enter 
    are used only to calculate the BMI at that moment. We do not share or sell your data 
    to any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because the App does not collect personal data, there is no user-specific data to protect 
    or delete on our end. All computation and data handling occur locally within the App 
    on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The App may contain links to external websites or services. We have no control over 
    the content and practices of these external sites and cannot accept responsibility 
    or liability for their privacy policies.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not targeted at children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect 
    personal data, we do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you believe a child 
    has installed the App in violation of local regulations, please contact us.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within 
    the App or on an associated website. Your continued use of the App after any such modification 
    constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy or the App,
