# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** [15/02/2025]

## 1. Introduction
Thank you for choosing the BMI Calculator app (“BMI Tracker”). This Privacy Policy describes how the App collects, uses, and shares information when you use our services. By installing and using the App, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## 2. Information We Collect
### 2.1 No Personal Information Collected
- The App does **not** require you to provide personal information such as name, email address, or contact details.  
- The App calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user-provided height and weight inputs, but **does not** store, track, or transmit these inputs to any server.

### 2.2 Non-Personal Usage Data
- The App does **not** use third-party analytics tools by default. If future updates introduce analytics to improve the user experience, any data collected will be anonymized and used solely for performance metrics. This Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly.

## 3. How We Use Your Information
- **Local Computation**: All BMI calculations occur locally on your device. The height and weight values you enter are used only to calculate the BMI at that moment.  
- **No Sharing**: We do **not** share or sell your data to any third parties.

## 4. Data Storage and Security
- The App does **not** store your BMI inputs or results on external servers.  
- Because we do not collect personal data, there is no user-specific data to protect or delete on our end.  
- All computation and data handling occur locally within the App on your device.

## 5. Third-Party Services
- The App may contain links to external websites or services (e.g., a link to a website for health tips). Please note that we have no control over the content and practices of these external sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their privacy policies.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
- Our App is **not** targeted at children under the age of 13. Since the App does not collect personal data, we do not knowingly collect information from minors. If you believe a child has installed the App and used it in violation of local regulations, please contact us.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected within the App or on an associated website. Your continued use of the App after any such modification constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
